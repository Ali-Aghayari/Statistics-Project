## **Techniques Used**

### **Statistical Techniques**
1. **Descriptive Statistics**:
   - Summarizing datasets using measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion (variance, standard deviation).
2. **Inferential Statistics**:
   - Hypothesis testing to draw conclusions about populations based on sample data.
   - Techniques such as t-tests, chi-square tests, and ANOVA.
3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Generating insightful plots to understand data distributions and trends:
     - Histograms
     - Box plots
     - Line graphs
     - Scatter plots
4. **Probability and Distribution Analysis**:
   - Working with probability distributions such as Normal, Binomial, and Poisson.
   - Simulating random variables for statistical modeling.
5. **Regression Analysis**:
   - Implementing simple and multiple regression models to predict outcomes.
6. **Custom Statistical Scripts**:
   - Python-based modular scripts for specific statistical problems:
     - Sequential computations
     - Step-by-step problem-solving
   - Automating repetitive statistical tasks.

### **Clustering and Graph-Based Techniques**
1. **Spectral Clustering Optimization**:
   - Gradient-based optimization on synthetic graphs to identify clusters effectively.
2. **K-Means Clustering**:
   - Applying K-means clustering for group discovery in high-dimensional data.
3. **Random Walk Clustering**:
   - Discovering graph clusters using random walking methods for node similarity and community detection.
